# Script Exploitation Lab
In this lab we will see how hackers can use a technique called *Script Exploitation* (also called *Script Injection* or *SQL Injection*) to hack into a database. In this lab we have a web page that talks to a database.
The web page asks for a username.
It then looks up the username and returns the matching password. We are going to *inject* a special code into the webpage so that it gives use this list of *all* passwords in the system, including the administrator's password.

Detailed instructions are on [this worksheet](https://github.com/APCSPrinciples/APCSPrinciples.github.io/blob/master/Worksheets/ScriptExploitationLab.docx?raw=true).
